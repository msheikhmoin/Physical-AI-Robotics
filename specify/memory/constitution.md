# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Academic Rigor and Accuracy
All content MUST be verified through primary-source verification. Claims MUST be reproducible and traceable to their origins. At least 50% of sources MUST be peer-reviewed.

### II. Academic Clarity and Target Audience
Content MUST maintain academic clarity suitable for a Computer Science (CS) audience. Flesch-Kincaid grade level MUST be between 10-12.

### III. Plagiarism-Free Content
Zero tolerance for plagiarism. All content MUST be original and properly cited using APA style.

### IV. Comprehensive Structure and Formatting
The book MUST be structured into 4 modules, each containing 3 chapters (progressing from beginner to advanced topics). The output MUST be in Docusaurus Markdown format, including introduction, literature review, methodology, analysis, and conclusion.

### V. Source and Length Requirements
The book MUST include at least 15 academic sources. The total word count MUST be between 5,000–7,000 words.

### VI. Docusaurus and Deployment Ready
The project MUST utilize Spec Kit-Plus for development. The final repository MUST be ready for GitHub Pages deployment, with Docusaurus Markdown for content and a PDF export with embedded APA citations as the final output.

## Book Structure

The book will be divided into four modules, each containing three chapters, progressing from beginner to advanced concepts in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The overall structure will follow a research paper format, including an Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Analysis, and Conclusion.

## Technical Implementation

The book content will be written in Docusaurus Markdown. The repository will be configured for GitHub Pages deployment, ensuring all necessary Docusaurus configurations are in place for static site generation.

## Governance
All proposed content and structural changes MUST adhere to the principles outlined in this constitution. Any amendments to this constitution require a documented rationale and approval by the project lead. Compliance with these rules will be regularly reviewed during the book development process.
