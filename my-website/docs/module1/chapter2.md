# Chapter 2: Core Concepts in Physical AI

Understanding Physical AI requires a grasp of several core concepts that bridge the gap between abstract intelligence and embodied action. This chapter will delineate these fundamental ideas, providing a lexicon and conceptual framework necessary for deeper exploration. We will cover the distinctions between traditional AI and Physical AI, delve into the role of embodiment, and introduce the basic components of a physical AI system, emphasizing the computational and hardware underpinnings.

## 2.1 Embodiment and Situatedness

A key differentiator for Physical AI is **embodiment**—the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction of a physical body with its environment (Pfeifer & Bongard, 2007). This contrasts with disembodied AI, which operates purely in simulated or abstract domains. **Situatedness** refers to the fact that an agent's intelligence is developed and expressed within a specific context or environment, influencing its perception, action, and learning. The physical form of a robot, including its degrees of freedom, sensor placement, and actuator capabilities, directly constrains and shapes its intelligence. For instance, a humanoid robot's bipedal locomotion demands complex balance control algorithms, executed in real-time on embedded processors, differentiating its intelligence profoundly from a stationary AI system.

## 2.2 Perception and Sensing

Physical AI systems rely heavily on **perception**—the process of acquiring, interpreting, selecting, and organizing sensory information from the environment. This involves various **sensors** (e.g., high-resolution cameras, multi-beam LiDAR, phased-array microphones, force-torque sensors, tactile arrays) that convert physical phenomena into digital signals. The processing of this raw data into meaningful environmental representations (e.g., semantic segmentation, object tracking, sound source localization, haptic feedback) often necessitates significant computational power. For mobile robotic platforms, on-board compute units like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin, featuring ARM Cortex-A78AE CPUs and a 2048-core NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU, provide the necessary parallel processing capabilities for real-time sensor fusion and inference from deep neural networks (NVIDIA, 2023a). This allows for tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or advanced visual odometry to be performed at rates crucial for dynamic interaction.

## 2.3 Action and Actuation

**Action** is how a physical AI system influences its environment. This is achieved through **actuators** (e.g., brushless DC motors with high-resolution encoders, pneumatic/hydraulic systems, soft robotics manipulators) that convert electrical or fluid energy into physical motion. The precision, speed, and force of these actuators are critical for dexterous manipulation and agile locomotion. The control signals for these actuators are generated by complex motion planners and controllers, often operating at kilohertz frequencies. The fidelity of these control loops depends on the rapid processing of sensor feedback and the execution of computationally intensive models, sometimes within stringent real-time operating system (RTOS) environments.

## 2.4 Control Systems and Feedback Loops

**Control systems** are the mechanisms that manage, command, direct, or regulate the behavior of other devices or systems. In Physical AI, these systems often employ **feedback loops**, where the output of a system (e.g., current joint angle) is measured and fed back into the input, allowing for continuous adjustment and error correction against desired trajectories. Advanced control strategies, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) or Impedance Control, require substantial computational resources to solve optimization problems in real-time. For complex humanoid movements, where balance and dynamic stability are paramount, these control computations can be offloaded to powerful discrete GPUs, such as an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 in a local workstation, especially during the development and policy learning phases for faster iteration cycles.

## 2.5 Learning and Adaptation

Physical AI systems often incorporate **learning and adaptation** mechanisms, allowing them to improve their performance over time and adjust to novel situations. This can involve various machine learning techniques, from reinforcement learning for optimal control policies to deep learning for complex perception tasks. The training of sophisticated deep neural networks for tasks like locomotion, manipulation, or human-robot interaction often occurs in simulated environments. These simulations can be computationally intensive, requiring GPU clusters or high-performance single-node GPUs like the RTX 4070 for efficient training of large models with millions of parameters (NVIDIA, 2023b). The ability to learn from experience, adapt to unforeseen circumstances, and generalize across different environments is a hallmark of truly intelligent physical systems.
