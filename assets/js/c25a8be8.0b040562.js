Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI agents operate under the constraints and opportunities of physical laws, requiring robust control, sensing, and manipulation capabilities. The development of such systems often demands significant computational resources for tasks like sensor data fusion, real-time decision-making, and complex motor control. For instance, the low-latency processing of high-dimensional sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution camera feeds) for instantaneous environmental mapping and obstacle avoidance often leverages specialized hardware. Embedded systems like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin are critical for deploying sophisticated AI models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object recognition or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for predictive control, directly onto the robotic platform (NVIDIA, 2023). This edge computing capability is paramount for reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing autonomy in dynamic, real-world scenarios."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.h2,{id:"12-the-rise-of-humanoid-robotics",children:"1.2 The Rise of Humanoid Robotics"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Humanoid robots, with their human-like bodies, are designed to navigate and operate in spaces built for humans. This form factor offers unique advantages for tasks requiring dexterity, locomotion on uneven terrain, and interaction with human-designed tools and interfaces. The complexity of controlling multi-degree-of-freedom humanoid robots, maintaining balance, and executing intricate tasks (e.g., opening a door, manipulating a fragile object) necessitates advanced algorithms for motion planning, inverse kinematics, and force control. These algorithms, especially when combined with real-time perception and learning, demand substantial processing power. High-end GPUs, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070, are frequently employed in research and development environments to accelerate the training of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies for humanoid locomotion and manipulation. These powerful GPUs enable rapid iteration and exploration of vast policy spaces, significantly reducing the time required to achieve robust and agile behaviors (OpenAI, 2019). The ability to simulate complex physics and high-fidelity sensor data in virtual environments, often accelerated by such powerful hardware, is a prerequisite for successful sim-to-real transfer in humanoid robotics."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.h2,{id:"13-scope-and-structure-of-the-book",children:"1.3 Scope and Structure of the Book"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"This book is structured into four modules, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced applications and future outlooks.
