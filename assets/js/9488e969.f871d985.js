Achieving dynamic and robust bipedal gaits on uneven terrain requires sophisticated control algorithms that can manage the robot's center of mass, foot placement, and joint torques in real-time.

This allows for rapid processing of sensor streams from multiple high-resolution cameras and LiDARs, crucial for tasks like real-time object detection, 3D scene reconstruction, and human pose estimation, without the latency associated with cloud-based processing. During the development and training phases, more powerful discrete GPUs, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 (featuring 5888 CUDA cores and 12 GB of GDDR6X memory), are extensively used in workstations to accelerate the training of large-scale deep reinforcement learning models and complex simulations before deployment to the embedded platforms.
