# Physical AI Book – High-Level Specification (Prepared for Tasks Generation)

## 1. Project Overview (No Change Required)
This project aims to create a structured, well-designed, and academically-aligned book on **Physical AI**, published using **Docusaurus**. 
The deliverable is a fully static documentation website containing chapters, diagrams, references, and architectural insights.

The content must follow:
- Academic rigor (APA style)
- Strong structure and modularity
- A clean Docusaurus layout
- Reusable patterns for future books

## 2. Project Goals (No Change Required)

### Primary Goals
1. Provide a complete, well-structured book on Physical AI.
2. Define a repeatable template for future technical books.
3. Integrate diagrams, ADRs, and open-standard documentation patterns.
4. Ensure quality validation, search readiness, and clean navigation.

## 3. Prioritized User Stories and Deliverables (Required for Tasks.md Generation)

### 3.1 High Priority User Stories (Foundation & Core Structure)

#### US-001: Foundational Content Creation
As the primary author, I want the full content for **Part 1 (Foundations)** (What is Physical AI?, Differences, Biological inspirations) to be written, reviewed, and formatted, so the theoretical base of the book is established immediately.
* Priority: High
* Mandatory Deliverables: Section Structure (section-structure.md), Chapter 1 Draft.
* Dependencies: Constitution is finalized.

#### US-002: Core Documentation Architecture
As the project maintainer, I need the entire documentation architecture defined, including the **Architecture Document (architecture.md)**, **Diagram (architecture-diagram.svg)**, and the first set of **ADR Files (ADR-001/002)**, so the project framework and design decisions are locked before writing Part 2.
* Priority: High
* Mandatory Deliverables: architecture.md, architecture-diagram.svg, ADR-001, ADR-002.

#### US-003: Robotics Systems Content (Part 2)
As the author, I need the content covering **Part 2 (Robotics & Embodied Systems)** (Sensors, Actuators, Control systems, Perception loops) created, so the practical hardware aspects of the book are documented next.
* Priority: High
* Mandatory Deliverables: Chapter 2 Draft, Quality Validation Rules (quality-validation.md) defined.

### 3.2 Medium Priority User Stories (Advanced Content & Quality)

#### US-004: Physical Cognition Content (Part 3)
As the author, I need the content for **Part 3 (Physical Cognition)** (Learning with embodiment, Reinforcement learning, Motor learning) drafted and reviewed, so the advanced AI topics are covered.
* Priority: Medium
* Mandatory Deliverables: Chapter 3 Draft, Acceptance Tests (tests/acceptance.md) written.

#### US-005: Applications and Future Content (Part 4 & 5)
As the author, I need the content for **Part 4 (Applications)** and **Part 5 (Future of Physical AI)** completed, so the book covers real-world use cases and forward-looking discussions.
* Priority: Medium
* Mandatory Deliverables: Chapter 4/5 Drafts.

### 3.3 Low Priority User Stories (Final Polish & History)

#### US-006: Docusaurus Integration & Styling
As the maintainer, I want all generated Markdown content integrated into the Docusaurus setup with consistent styling, sidebar configuration, and search plugin activated, so the book is ready for publishing.
* Priority: Low
* Mandatory Deliverables: Final Docusaurus setup, Commands for linting/formatting ready.

#### US-007: Prompt History Finalization
As the maintainer, I need the complete Prompt History Record (PHR) filed, so the project's AI interactions are fully documented.
* Priority: Low
* Mandatory Deliverables: Prompt History Record (PHR) filed.
