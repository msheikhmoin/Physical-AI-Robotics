# ADR-008 Security Considerations for Static Site

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Security is a paramount concern for any web project. While a static site generated by Docusaurus inherently has a significantly reduced attack surface compared to dynamic applications, it is still important to document and address potential security considerations relevant to static content delivery.

## Decision

The project will implement security best practices relevant to static websites and Docusaurus, focusing on:

1.  **Elimination of Server-Side Vulnerabilities**: By choosing a static architecture (ADR-003), the most common server-side vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS in backend, authentication bypass) are mitigated.
2.  **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a restrictive CSP to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other content injection attacks.
3.  **Dependency Management**: Regularly update Docusaurus and its plugins to their latest stable versions to mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
4.  **Secure Hosting**: Leverage secure hosting environments like GitHub Pages, which handle HTTPS and other infrastructure-level security concerns.
5.  **No Sensitive Data Handling**: Ensure no sensitive user data is collected, stored, or processed by the static site itself.

## Consequences

*   **Positive**:
    *   **High Inherent Security**: Static sites are fundamentally more secure against common web attacks.
    *   **Reduced Security Overhead**: Less need for continuous security monitoring and patching compared to dynamic applications.
    *   **Compliance**: Easier to adhere to basic security compliance requirements due to simplicity.
*   **Negative**:
    *   **Client-Side Vulnerabilities**: Still susceptible to client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., misconfigured CSP, vulnerable JavaScript libraries) if not properly managed.
    *   **Phishing/Social Engineering**: Static sites cannot protect users from external phishing attacks.
    *   **DDoS Risk**: While infrastructure typically handles this, very large static assets could be targeted.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **Implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Rejected as unnecessary for a static content site. The overhead and cost of a WAF are not justified given the minimal attack surface.
*   **Extensive Penetration Testing**: While valuable for any project, for a static site, initial focus will be on preventive measures and best practices rather than extensive reactive testing, which may be disproportionately costly for the reduced risk profile.
*   **Complex User Authentication/Authorization**: Rejected as outside the scope of a static content delivery platform. If such features are required in the future, a different architectural approach would be necessary.
