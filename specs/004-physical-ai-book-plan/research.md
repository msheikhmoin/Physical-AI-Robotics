# Research Approach

The research for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics book will adopt a research-concurrent approach, meaning research will be conducted iteratively alongside the writing process rather than as an upfront, monolithic phase. This allows for continuous learning, adaptation, and refinement of the content based on emerging insights and validated sources.

## Sources and Tools

*   **Primary Sources**: Emphasis will be placed on peer-reviewed academic papers, conference proceedings, and reputable scientific journals. At least 50% of all cited sources will be peer-reviewed, as mandated by the project Constitution.
*   **Secondary Sources**: High-quality textbooks, technical reports from leading research institutions, and established industry whitepapers will supplement primary sources.
*   **Search Engines & Databases**: Academic search engines (e.g., Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library) and university library databases will be primary tools for source identification.
*   **Reference Management**: A citation management tool (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley) will be used to organize references and generate APA style citations and bibliographies.

## Frameworks and References

*   The content will be grounded in established theories and frameworks within the fields of Physical AI, Robotics, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction.
*   Key reference texts and foundational works will be identified and continuously consulted throughout the writing process.

## Citation Style

All citations and bibliographies MUST strictly adhere to the American Psychological Association (APA) citation style, as specified in the project Constitution. This includes in-text citations and a comprehensive reference list.

## Collaboration

Research findings and insights will be regularly shared and discussed with the project lead and collaborators to ensure alignment and address any ambiguities or discrepancies.
