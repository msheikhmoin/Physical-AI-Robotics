# Contracts

For this project, which involves creating a Docusaurus-based book, external API contracts are not directly applicable. The "contracts" in this context primarily refer to:

1.  **Content Structure Contracts**: Defined by the Docusaurus Markdown format, folder structure for modules and chapters, and `sidebars.ts` configuration.
2.  **Constitutional Contracts**: Adherence to the project's Constitution regarding academic rigor, formatting, citation style (APA), and deployment readiness.

No formal API contracts are required for the static site generation process itself.
