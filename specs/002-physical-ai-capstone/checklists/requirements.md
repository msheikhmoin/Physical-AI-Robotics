✔️ Functional Requirements

 Voice command → structured task pipeline

 Navigation (Nav2 or equivalent)

 Object identification (vision model)

 Manipulation skill execution

 Simulation environment working end-to-end

 Logging + evaluation outputs

✔️ Non-Functional Requirements

 Works on cloud or on-prem hardware

 Runs on ROS2 (Humble recommended)

 Uses GPU acceleration when available

 Modular task pipeline

✔️ Hardware Requirements

 RTX 4070 Ti+

 Jetson Orin Nano/NX

 Humanoid or legged robot model

 Optional sensors (Intel RealSense, mic)

✔️ Project Constraints

 No full code samples included

 No full lesson plans

 All clarification questions resolved (User choice: B)

✔️ Acceptance Criteria

 Robot can perform full pipeline: Voice → Plan → Navigate → Identify → Manipulate

 Simulation runs end-to-end with no manual intervention

 All diagrams + workflows documented clearly

 Readiness confirmed for /sp.plan phase
