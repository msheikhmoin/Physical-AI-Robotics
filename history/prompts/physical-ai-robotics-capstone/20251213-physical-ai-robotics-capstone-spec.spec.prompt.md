## Response snapshot

Generated a Capstone Specification (`specs/1-physical-ai-robotics-capstone/spec.md`) including sections for Deployment Environment Feature Comparison and High-Level Architecture. Also created a quality checklist (`specs/1-physical-ai-robotics-capstone/checklists/requirements.md`). Noted limitations with `run_shell_command` preventing automatic branch creation and script execution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully generated detailed Capstone Specification and quality checklist.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User needs to manually create git branch and may clarify spec details.
- 🧠 Reflection: Persistent 'run_shell_command' errors significantly hampered automation, requiring manual steps and assumptions. The new user prompt was truncated, leading to interpretation of a combined new and previous request.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: run_shell_command consistently failing; truncated user inputs.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate and resolve 'run_shell_command' parsing errors.
